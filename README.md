### Hi there 👋

<!--
**jakecinco/jakecinco** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm currently on my final year of MSc Computer Science.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my MSc CS project - a clinical trial management system (CTMS) built using modern web technologies such as ReactJS for frontend components, Django for REST API server and relational database, POSTGRES. Not going to bore you with a long list of tech stacks that will be used but the aim is to learn modern web development technologies and create a full stack prototype which later can be turned into an MVP.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning software design patterns particularly in Java, information and network security and data management with SQL. It' challenging to learn all these during these special time. Online class is definitely not for me but I have to push through.
- 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on healthcare or research-related projects, or any interesting React projects (the basic ones for now).
- 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with ... a lot of things for sure but can't name one right now.
- 
- 💬 Ask me about clinical trials processes in the NHS, research in dementia, general nursing, COVID vaccines.
